# TE-1-16-Flashing-LED PROJECT ONE 

One of the simplest and most effective circuits using the 555 timer is a low frequency oscillator driving a LED. In this first project the components have been chosen to give a frequency of about 2 cycles per second (2Hz). This means the LED will blink twice per second. The whole circuit uses just 7 components. These are soldered onto the top of the experimenter board as shown in the layout diagram. You will need 7 jumper wires to connect the IC pins to the parts via the copper tracks. Use a 9v battery to power the LED and connect the battery snap to the positive and negative tracks as shown. Before connecting the battery, check over these 5 points: 

1. Does the dot on the end of the IC align with pin 1 on the board? 
2. Does the long lead of the LED connect to pin 3? 
3. Does the positive of the 10mfd electrolytic connect to pins 6 and 2? 
4. Are the 7 jumper wires in position? 
5. Are all the 8 pins of the IC connected? 

Connect the battery. With a little bit of luck the LED will flash at 2Hz! If it doesn't, don't despair. Read the project through again. Look for these 6 possible faults: 

1. Battery connected around the wrong way. 
2. Solder bridging the copper tracks near the IC. 
3. Parts touching. 
4. LED inserted the wrong way around. 
5. A missing jumper wire or part. 
6. Weak battery.
